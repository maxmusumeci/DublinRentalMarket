# DublinRentalMarket

This project's purpose is to model Dublin's housing market under systems dynamics principles using NetLogo. The project is an educational toy model that can be used to simulate properties of Dublin's housing market. This project was created to test whether Dublin's housing market had "self-organizing" properties seen in many systems. The sliders on the left side can be adjusted to change parameters in the housing market. Each parameter is explained in detail in the report here. (link report here or just reference it ig)
